# Calculating the optimal parameters for a BBO crystal for SHG: Phase matching angles and thickness

### In this repository I will describe what are the relevant parameters for a BBO and how to calculate them, for the application of Second Harmonic Generation. Most expressions will be general, meaning they will be applicable for a wide range of laser wavelengths and intensities, but I will also show specific values to get a sense of the orders of magnitudes. 

## Introduction

BBO is a crystal... it can be used for 2nd order ....
In the common setting of... the relevant parameters are...

## The angles $\theta$ and $\alpha$. 

### Nonlinear eq 

### Index of refractions....

### angular dependence

### code...


## Thickness
