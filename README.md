# Calculating the optimal parameters for a BBO crystal for SHG: Phase matching angles and thickness

### In this repository I will describe what are the relevant parameters for a BBO and how to calculate them, for the application of Second Harmonic Generation. Most expressions will be general, meaning they will be applicable for a wide range of laser wavelengths and intensities, but I will also show specific values to get a sense of the orders of magnitudes. 

#### Please refer to the notebook bbo_optimal_parameters.ipynb for all the calculations and explanations.
